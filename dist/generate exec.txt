Running Your Executable at Startup in Ubuntu
Step 1: Locate or Create Your Executable
Locate the Executable
After using PyInstaller with your .py file, find the executable in the dist directory within your project folder.

Create the Executable
If you haven't created the executable yet, install PyInstaller and run it against your script:

bash

pip install pyinstaller
pyinstaller --onefile --windowed your_script_name.py


Step 2: Add the Executable to Startup Applications

A. Open Startup Applications
Press the Super key (usually the Windows key on most keyboards).
Type "Startup Applications" and open it.
B. Add Your Program
Click "Add" to create a new startup application entry.
In the "Name" field, type a descriptive name for your program, e.g., "IP Widget".
In the "Command" field, click "Browse" and navigate to the executable in the dist folder. Select it.
Optionally, in the "Comment" field, add a brief description of your application.
Click "Add" to finalize the addition.
Your application is now set to launch automatically at each system startup.

Step 3: Test Your Setup
To ensure everything is set up correctly, you might want to restart your computer and check if the application starts as expected.

If the standard method through "Startup Applications" does not work on your Ubuntu machine, another approach involves using the .config/autostart directory in your home folder. This method manually adds applications to startup by creating .desktop files. Here's how to do it:

Creating a .desktop File for Your Application
Open a terminal and create a new .desktop file in the autostart folder:
bash

nano ~/.config/autostart/ipwidget.desktop
Insert the following content into the file, replacing /path/to/your/executable with the absolute path to your executable:
ini

[Desktop Entry]
Type=Application
Name=IP Widget
Exec=/path/to/your/executable
X-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=true
  
Save and close the file. If you're using nano, do this with Ctrl+O, Enter then Ctrl+X.
Explanation of Fields:
Type=Application indicates it's an application.
Name=IP Widget is the name of your application as it will appear in startup management tools.
Exec=/path/to/your/executable should point to your widget's executable.
X-GNOME-Autostart-enabled=true ensures the application is enabled at startup.
Testing the Setup
After creating and configuring your .desktop file, restart your computer to test if the application launches correctly at startup.

This method should work on most Linux distributions that use GNOME or compatible desktop environments. If your system uses a different desktop environment, autostart support may vary.
